# Title

This is `menu_1` for the website template.

## More info

Like the `index.Rmd` and `page_1.Rmd` files, this is a regular R Markdown document. 
Put anything you like here, including R code:

```{r}
plot(rnorm(500), runif(500))
```

## About the YAML header

Note that the YAML header is pretty minimal--just a title.
