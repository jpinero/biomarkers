# Title

This is the home page for a template website you can build yourself.

## More info

This is a regular R Markdown document. 
Put anything you like here, including R code.

## About the YAML header

Note that the YAML header is pretty minimal--just a title.

## Rendering the site

1. Run `rmarkdown::render_site()` from the same directory as the `_site.yml` file.
2. View the output in the directory your YAML file specifies in `output_dir`.
The template says: `output_dir: "docs"` so look in `docs/`.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view your handywork.
