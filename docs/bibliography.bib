DisGeNET is a comprehensive discovery platform designed to address a variety of questions concerning the genetic underpinning of human diseases. DisGeNET contains over 380 000 associations between {\textgreater}16 000 genes and 13 000 diseases, which makes it one of the largest repositories currently available of its kind. DisGeNET integrates expert-curated databases with text-mined data, covers information on Mendelian and complex diseases, and includes data from animal disease models. It features a score based on the supporting evidence to prioritize gene-disease associations. It is an open access resource available through a web interface, a Cytoscape plugin and as a Semantic Web resource. The web interface supports user-friendly data exploration and navigation. DisGeNET data can also be analysed via the DisGeNET Cytoscape plugin, and enriched with the annotations of other plugins of this popular network analysis software suite. Finally, the information contained in DisGeNET can be expanded and complemented using Semantic Web technologies and linked to a variety of resources already present in the Linked Data cloud. Hence, DisGeNET offers one of the most comprehensive collections of human gene-disease associations and a valuable set of tools for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying diseases of genetic origin, designed to fulfill the needs of different user profiles, including bioinformaticians, biologists and health-care practitioners.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Bravo et al.; licensee BioMed Central. Background: Current biomedical research needs to leverage and exploit the large amount of information reported in scientific publications. Automated text mining approaches, in particular those aimed at finding relationships between entities, are key for identification of actionable knowledge from free text repositories. We present the BeFree system aimed at identifying relationships between biomedical entities with a special focus on genes and their associated diseases. Results: By exploiting morpho-syntactic information of the text, BeFree is able to identify gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations with state-of-the-art performance. The application of BeFree to real-case scenarios shows its effectiveness in extracting information relevant for translational research. We show the value of the gene-disease associations extracted by BeFree through a number of analyses and integration with other data sources. BeFree succeeds in identifying genes associated to a major cause of morbidity worldwide, depression, which are not present in other public resources. Moreover, large-scale extraction and analysis of gene-disease associations, and integration with current biomedical knowledge, provided interesting insights on the kind of information that can be found in the literature, and raised challenges regarding data prioritization and curation. We found that only a small proportion of the gene-disease associations discovered by using BeFree is collected in expert-curated databases. Thus, there is a pressing need to find alternative strategies to manual curation, in order to review, prioritize and curate text-mining data and incorporate it into domain-specific databases. We present our strategy for data prioritization and discuss its implications for supporting biomedical research and applications. Conclusions: BeFree is a novel text mining system that performs competitively for the identification of gene-disease, drug-disease and drug-target associations. Our analyses show that mining only a small fraction of MEDLINE results in a large dataset of gene-disease associations, and only a small proportion of this dataset is actually recorded in curated resources (2{\%}), raising several issues on data prioritization and curation. We propose that joint analysis of text mined data with data curated by experts appears as a suitable approach to both assess data quality and highlight novel and interesting information.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016. The information about the genetic basis of human diseases lies at the heart of precision medicine and drug discovery. However, to realize its full potential to support these goals, several problems, such as fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability and different conceptualization of the data must be overcome. To provide the community with a resource free of these hurdles, we have developed DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org), one of the largest available collections of genes and variants involved in human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype-phenotype relationships. The information is accessible through a web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL endpoint, scripts in several programming languages and an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform that can be used for different research purposes including the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of specific human diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypothesis on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}One of the most pressing challenges in genomic medicine is to understand the role played by genetic variation in health and disease. Thanks to the exploration of genomic variants at large scale, hundreds of thousands of disease-associated loci have been uncovered. However, the identification of variants of clinical relevance is a significant challenge that requires comprehensive interrogation of previous knowledge and linkage to new experimental results. To assist in this complex task, we created DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org/), a knowledge management platform integrating and standardizing data about disease associated genes and variants from multiple sources, including the scientific literature. DisGeNET covers the full spectrum of human diseases as well as normal and abnormal traits. The current release covers more than 24 000 diseases and traits, 17 000 genes and 117 000 genomic variants. The latest developments of DisGeNET include new sources of data, novel data attributes and prioritization metrics, a redesigned web interface and recently launched APIs. Thanks to the data standardization, the combination of expert curated information with data automatically mined from the scientific literature, and a suite of tools for accessing its publicly available data, DisGeNET is an interoperable resource supporting a variety of applications in genomic medicine and drug R{\&}D.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Bundschus2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The increasing amount of published literature in biomedicine represents an immense source of knowledge, which can only efficiently be accessed by a new generation of automated information extraction tools. Named entity recognition of well-defined objects, such as genes or proteins, has achieved a sufficient level of maturity such that it can form the basis for the next step: the extraction of relations that exist between the recognized entities. Whereas most early work focused on the mere detection of relations, the classification of the type of relation is also of great importance and this is the focus of this work. In this paper we describe an approach that extracts both the existence of a relation and its type. Our work is based on Conditional Random Fields, which have been applied with much success to the task of named entity recognition. RESULTS We benchmark our approach on two different tasks. The first task is the identification of semantic relations between diseases and treatments. The available data set consists of manually annotated PubMed abstracts. The second task is the identification of relations between genes and diseases from a set of concise phrases, so-called GeneRIF (Gene Reference Into Function) phrases. In our experimental setting, we do not assume that the entities are given, as is often the case in previous relation extraction work. Rather the extraction of the entities is solved as a subproblem. Compared with other state-of-the-art approaches, we achieve very competitive results on both data sets. To demonstrate the scalability of our solution, we apply our approach to the complete human GeneRIF database. The resulting gene-disease network contains 34758 semantic associations between 4939 genes and 1745 diseases. The gene-disease network is publicly available as a machine-readable RDF graph. CONCLUSION We extend the framework of Conditional Random Fields towards the annotation of semantic relations from text and apply it to the biomedical domain. Our approach is based on a rich set of textual features and achieves a performance that is competitive to leading approaches. The model is quite general and can be extended to handle arbitrary biological entities and relation types. The resulting gene-disease network shows that the GeneRIF database provides a rich knowledge source for text mining. Current work is focused on improving the accuracy of detection of entities as well as entity boundaries, which will also greatly improve the relation extraction performance.},

Utilisation of biomarkers has a potential to make drug discovery, development and approval processes more efficient. An overview of the current global regulatory landscape is presented in this article with particular emphasis on the validation and qualification of biomarkers, as well as legal framework for companion diagnostics. Furthermore, this article shows how the number of approved drugs with at least 1 biomarker used during development (biomarker acceptance) is affected by the recent advances in the biomarker regulations. More than half of analysed approvals were supported by biomarker data and there has been a slight increase in acceptance of biomarkers in recent years, even though the growth is not continuous. For certain pharmacotherapeutic groups, approvals with biomarkers are more common than without. Examples include immunosuppressants, immunostimulants, drugs used in diabetes, antithrombotic drugs, antineoplastic agents and antivirals. As a conclusion, potential benefits, challenges and opportunities of using biomarkers in drug discovery and development in the current regulatory landscape are summarised and discussed.},

abstract = {Background: The large volume of medical literature makes it difficult for healthcare professionals to keep abreast of the latest studies that support Evidence-Based Medicine. Natural language processing enhances the access to relevant information, and gold standard corpora are required to improve systems. To contribute with a new dataset for this domain, we collected the Clinical Trials for Evidence-Based Medicine in Spanish (CT-EBM-SP) corpus. Methods: We annotated 1200 texts about clinical trials with entities from the Unified Medical Language System semantic groups: anatomy (ANAT), pharmacological and chemical substances (CHEM), pathologies (DISO), and lab tests, diagnostic or therapeutic procedures (PROC). We doubly annotated 10% of the corpus and measured inter-annotator agreement (IAA) using F-measure. As use case, we run medical entity recognition experiments with neural network models. Results: This resource contains 500 abstracts of journal articles about clinical trials and 700 announcements of trial protocols (292 173 tokens). We annotated 46 699 entities (13.98% are nested entities). Regarding IAA agreement, we obtained an average F-measure of 85.65% (±4.79, strict match) and 93.94% (±3.31, relaxed match). In the use case experiments, we achieved recognition results ranging from 80.28% (±00.99) to 86.74% (±00.19) of average F-measure. Conclusions: Our results show that this resource is adequate for experiments with state-of-the-art approaches to biomedical named entity recognition.

abstract = {Purpose of review: To summarize the major methodological issues concerning prognostic biomarkers in nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and to discuss integration of biomarkers into clinical trials. Recent findings: Large phase 3 trials have recently been published in early-resected NSCLC with studies of biomarkers identifying subsets of patients that benefited most from the experimental perioperative strategy. The lALT-bio study reported that ERCC1 DNA-repair protein had prognostic and predictive implications. Other studies reported on the prognostic role of TUBB3 expression in stages I-Ill NSCLCs. The IPASS study reported the predictive and prognostic impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in stage IV patients treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor or platinum-based chemotherapy. Whereas EGFR mutations studies received prospective validation with trials in which treatment allocation was based on biomarker status, chemotherapy biomarkers still need such prospective confirmations, and many biases were still encountered in recent published studies. Summary: Biomarkers of treatment efficacy will help to tailor treatment in NSCLCs. EGFR mutations have reached that point. Markers of chemotherapy efficacy still need validation studies before coming into routine practice. Stringent methodological recommendations should avoid most of the possible pitfalls of those studies and allow clinical applicability of such biomarkers. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health I Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

The International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease aimed to outline biomarker definitions, categories, and operating properties required for their use in registration trials and clinical practice. Using fecal calprotectin as an example, we provide a framework for biomarker development and validation in patients with IBD. Methods: We reviewed international society guidelines, regulatory agency guidance documents, and standardized reporting guidelines for biomarkers, in combination with publications on fecal calprotectin levels in patients with IBD. We assessed the validity of fecal calprotectin to serve as a surrogate biomarker of IBD activity and outlined a framework for further validation and development of biomarkers. Results: No endpoints have been fully validated as surrogates of risk of disease complications; mucosal healing is the most valid endpoint used to determine risk of disease complications. Fecal level of calprotectin has not been validated as a biomarker for IBD activity because of lack of technical and clinical reliability, assessment of performance when used as a replacement for endoscopy, and assessment of responsiveness to changes in disease states. The level of fecal calprotectin can be used only as a prognostic factor for disease recurrence in patients in remission after medical or surgical treatment. Conclusions: We reviewed guidelines, regulatory documents, and publications to identify properties required for the development of biomarkers of IBD activity and areas in need of clarification from regulatory agencies and societies. We propose a path forward for research of biomarkers for IBD.},

abstract = {The transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2; encoded by NFE2L2) plays a critical role in the maintenance of cellular redox and metabolic homeostasis, as well as the regulation of inflammation and cellular detoxication pathways. The contribution of the NRF2 pathway to organismal homeostasis is seen in many studies using cell lines and animal models, raising intense attention towards targeting its clinical promise. Over the last three decades, an expanding number of clinical studies have examined NRF2 inducers targeting an ever-widening range of diseases. Full understanding of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of drug candidates rely partly on the identification, validation, and use of biomarkers to optimize clinical applications. This review focuses on results from clinical trials with four agents known to target NRF2 signaling in preclinical studies (dimethyl fumarate, bardoxolone methyl, oltipraz, and sulforaphane), and evaluates the successes and limitations of biomarkers focused on expression of NRF2 target genes and others, inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers, carcinogen metabolism and adduct biomarkers in unavoidably exposed populations, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics. While no biomarkers excel at defining pharmacodynamic actions in this setting, it is clear that these four lead clinical compounds do touch the NRF2 pathway in humans.},

abstract = {The use of biomarkers is becoming increasingly intrinsic to the practice of medicine and holds great promise for transforming the practice of rheumatology. Biomarkers have the potential to aid clinical diagnosis when symptoms are present or to provide a means of detecting early signs of disease when they are not. Some biomarkers can serve as early surrogates of eventual clinical outcomes or guide therapeutic decision making by enabling identification of individuals likely to respond to a specific therapy. Using biomarkers might reduce the costs of drug development by enabling individuals most likely to respond to be enrolled in clinical trials, thereby minimizing the number of participants required. In this Review, we discuss the current use and the potential of biomarkers in rheumatology and in select fields at the forefront of biomarker research. We emphasize the value of different types of biomarkers, addressing the concept of 'actionable' biomarkers, which can be used to guide clinical decision making, and 'mechanistic' biomarkers, a subtype of actionable biomarker that is embedded in disease pathogenesis and, therefore, represents a potentially superior biomarker. We provide examples of actionable and mechanistic biomarkers currently available, and discuss how development of such biomarkers could revolutionize clinical practice and drug development. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {To improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression-based "intrinsic" subtypes luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like. Methods A 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using icroarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (nosystemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen.Results The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for pCR of 97%. Conclusion Diagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the continuous risk score will be of value for the management of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk score can also be used to assess the likelihood of efficacy from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

a@article{Tasneem2012,
abstract = {Background The ClinicalTrials.gov registry provides information regarding characteristics of past, current, and planned clinical studies to patients, clinicians, and researchers; in addition, registry data are available for bulk download. However, issues related to data structure, nomenclature, and changes in data collection over time present challenges to the aggregate analysis and interpretation of these data in general and to the analysis of trials according to clinical specialty in particular. Improving usability of these data could enhance the utility of ClinicalTrials.gov as a research resource.   Methods/Principal Results The purpose of our project was twofold. First, we sought to extend the usability of ClinicalTrials.gov for research purposes by developing a database for aggregate analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) that contains data from the 96,346 clinical trials registered as of September 27, 2010. Second, we developed and validated a methodology for annotating studies by clinical specialty, using a custom taxonomy employing Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms applied by an NLM algorithm, as well as MeSH terms and other disease condition terms provided by study sponsors. Clinical specialists reviewed and annotated MeSH and non-MeSH disease condition terms, and an algorithm was created to classify studies into clinical specialties based on both MeSH and non-MeSH annotations. False positives and false negatives were evaluated by comparing algorithmic classification with manual classification for three specialties.   Conclusions/Significance The resulting AACT database features study design attributes parsed into discrete fields, integrated metadata, and an integrated MeSH thesaurus, and is available for download as Oracle extracts (.dmp file and text format). This publicly-accessible dataset will facilitate analysis of studies and permit detailed characterization and analysis of the U.S. clinical trials enterprise as a whole. In addition, the methodology we present for creating specialty datasets may facilitate other efforts to analyze studies by specialty groups.},

However, the use of different reagents and protocols for RNA sequencing often produces incompatible results. Recently, we published the Oncobox Atlas of RNA sequencing profiles for normal human tissues obtained from healthy donors killed in road accidents. This is a database of molecular profiles obtained using uniform protocol and reagents settings that can be broadly used in biomedicine for data normalization in pathology, including cancer. Here, we publish new original 39 breast cancer (BC) and 19 lung cancer (LC) RNA sequencing profiles obtained for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples, fully compatible with the Oncobox Atlas. We performed the first correlation study of RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry-measured expression profiles for the clinically actionable biomarker genes in FFPE cancer tissue samples. We demonstrated high (Spearman’s rho 0.65–0.798) and statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.00004) correlations between the RNA sequencing (Oncobox protocol) and immunohistochemical measurements for HER2/ERBB2, ER/ESR1 and PGR genes in BC, and for PDL1 gene in LC; AUC: 0.963 for HER2, 0.921 for ESR1, 0.912 for PGR, and 0.922 for PDL1. To our knowledge, this is the first validation that total RNA sequencing of archived FFPE materials provides a reliable estimation of marker protein levels. These results show that in the future, RNA sequencing can complement immunohistochemistry for reliable measurements of the expression biomarkers in FFPE cancer samples.},

abstract = {A multicenter comparison of DNA methylation assays identifies robust methods for translational research and clinical diagnostics. DNA methylation patterns are altered in numerous diseases and often correlate with clinically relevant information such as disease subtypes, prognosis and drug response. With suitable assays and after validation in large cohorts, such associations can be exploited for clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment decisions. Here we describe the results of a community-wide benchmarking study comparing the performance of all widely used methods for DNA methylation analysis that are compatible with routine clinical use. We shipped 32 reference samples to 18 laboratories in seven different countries. Researchers in those laboratories collectively contributed 21 locus-specific assays for an average of 27 predefined genomic regions, as well as six global assays. We evaluated assay sensitivity on low-input samples and assessed the assays' ability to discriminate between cell types. Good agreement was observed across all tested methods, with amplicon bisulfite sequencing and bisulfite pyrosequencing showing the best all-round performance. Our technology comparison can inform the selection, optimization and use of DNA methylation assays in large-scale validation studies, biomarker development and clinical diagnostics.},

	abstract = {A number of biomarkers are used clinically and many protein-based assay methods are available. Improvements in the method to utilize specific antibodies have led to remarkable progress in clinical diagnosis using biomarkers. Proteomics studies to identify better biomarkers have been performed worldwide by using a protein-based comprehensive method. The detection rate of conventional biomarkers can not improve further. Now is a time that a breakthrough is needed. We previously proposed mRNA, which is circulating in the body, as a novel material for biomarkers. mRNA is an unexpectedly useful molecule, not only because it can detect genes with a low expression level in protein, but also because it can detect the expression from non-coding RNA precursor genes or gene products with limited secretion from the cells. Circulating mRNA has been thought to be unstable in blood containing RNase. We confirm that mRNA remains at the same level for 24 hours after blood sampling. Unlike DNA, the RNA molecule can reflect events in the human body which occurred within a day, resulting in an early diagnosis of diseases. We report the possibility to detect and quantify cancer-derived mRNAs circulating in human vessels. We introduce the detection of serum mRNA as a useful biomarker of human malignancies.},
