The Child-Pugh (CP) classification is a scoring system used for the classification of the severity of cirrhosis. It includes three continuous variables (bilirubin, albumin and INR) and two discrete variables (ascites and encephalopathy). Each variable is scored 1-3 with 3 indicating most severe derangement. The determination of CP score may range from 5 to 15 and the final score allows to categorize patients in Child-Pugh A (5-6 points), B (7-9 points) and C (10-15 points).

The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system aims at stratifying recipients by their disease severity according to a score estimating the 3-month probability of death on the waiting list. The calculation of an individual's MELD score is based on three objective lab parameters (bilirubin, serum creatinine and prothrombin time expressed as international normalized ratio, INR) and it includes logarithmic transformations and multiplication by several factors. It ranges between 6 and 40.
