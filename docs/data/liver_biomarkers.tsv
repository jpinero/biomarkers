D017093	213	NCT01013194	Assessment of the efficacy of human fetal liver progenitor cell transplantation on Child-Pugh score. The Child-Pugh (CP) classification is a scoring system used for the classification of the severity of cirrhosis. It includes three continuous variables (bilirubin, albumin and INR) and two discrete variables (ascites and encephalopathy). Each variable is scored 1-3 with 3 indicating most severe derangement. The determination of CP score may range from 5 to 15 and the final score allows to categorize patients in Child-Pugh A (5-6 points), B (7-9 points) and C (10-15 points). The highest is the score the sickest is the patient.	Assessment of the efficacy of human fetal liver progenitor cell transplantation on Child-Pugh score.

Scores are multiplied by 10 and rounded to the nearest whole number and range from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill). MELD scores were determined at Baseline (Day 1) and again at Week 12, Follow-up (FU) Week 12 (Week 24), and FU Week 24 (Week 36).

Change from baseline in MELD score = Post-baseline MELD score - baseline MELD score.	protein	2014	2014-04-16	F2	Liver Failure
