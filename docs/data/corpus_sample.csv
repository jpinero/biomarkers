NCT00866619	CD considered were CD1 for ISA and CD1 and CD2 for MH. ISA of CD1 was defined as a documented hemoglobin < 5.0 g/dL identified at clinical presentation to morbidity surveillance system in association with a P. falciparum parasitemia > 5000 parasites/μL. MH of CD1 was defined as a medical hospitalization with confirmed P. falciparum > 5000 parasites/μL. MH of CD2 was defined as a hospitalization which, in the judgment of the principal investigator, P. falciparum infection was the sole or a major contributing factor to the presentation. Results presented are uncorrected for double enrollment of one subject in 5-17 months age category receiving GSK257049 vaccine.	CD2	CD2	cell surface

Baseline value is defined as the latest pre-dose assessment. Ratio to Baseline was calculated as ratio of post-dose visit value over Baseline value. Statistical analysis of changes from baseline were performed on log-transformed data. Results were transformed back via exponential transformation such that treatment comparisons are assessed via odds ratios. Estimated ratio of geometric means (each visit over Baseline) and 95% confidence interval (CI) have been presented.	Albumin	ALB	protein

Participants were counted in the worst case category that their value changes to (Low, Normal or High), unless there is no change in their category. Participants whose value category was unchanged (e.g. High to High) or whose value became normal, are recorded in the 'To Normal or No Change' category. Participants were counted twice if the participant had values that changed 'To Low' and 'To High', so the percentages may not add to 100 percent. Baseline is the latest pre-dose assessment with a non-missing value, including those from unscheduled visits. Only categories with non-zero values have been presented.	Albumin	ALB	protein
